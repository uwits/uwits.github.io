Come down to the UniBar on Tuesday at 5pm to have some fun and get to meet some great, like minded people.

It's St. PatWITS DAY!

Our first social gathering for the year where you can meet up, have a drink, shoot some pool and grab a bite to eat with people from WITS and the EIS faculty. A fantastic way to start networking and make valuable friendships!
