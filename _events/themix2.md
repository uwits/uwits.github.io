If you're looking for team members for Hackagong, wanting to bounce some project ideas around, or if you're just in need of a drink with some like-minded people... come along to one (or all) of our pub meetups!

* First drink we'll shout (beer or wine)
* Some nibblies (chips + wedges)
* Many awesomeness, much epic, such wow
* Free Hackagong entry ticket ($50 value) for anyone who wears a Hackagong 2012-2014 shirt. Wear it again and we'll shout you an extra beer :)
