WITS MIX starts up June 4th 4:30pm at the Unibar.
 
This is a fun social event for members to come by and hang out, meet new people, discuss ideas and interests, talk about new projects and just generally have a good time.
 
So bring a friend along, meet some new people and maybe start something new.
 
We hope to see you there!
