WITS, in coordination with the South Coast Linux Users Group (SCLUG) would like to invite you to the Linux Installfest being held at Building 3, University of Wollongong on Saturday 25th July 9am - 12pm.

This will be a great chance for you to get hands on experience with an open source operating system (Ubuntu 14.04.2). In this guided installation you will learn from experienced users as we walk through the setup and discuss some of the benefits that a Linux OS provides.
