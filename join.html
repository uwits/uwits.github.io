				<h1>Who are we?</h1>

				<p>Hi! We are WITS, the University of Wollongong Information Technology Society (almost as bad as S.H.I.E.L.D). We are a society for UOW students interested in technology and the IT community. Members can socialise, work together on projects, learn about technology and gain exposure in the industry. We have members interested in programming, networking, gaming - really, anything related to computers!</p>
